\section{Lower bounds on the price of malice}

\newthought{How high} can the price of malice be?
In this section we study the havoc a malicious player is able to cause by constructing an example network.
Though a strict upper bound for the price of malice is not yet known.
Which properties of a network may cause a high price of malice?
We take a look at this two main reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item edges that \emph{congest fast} if a small load is added by a malicious player
	\item and \emph{long paths} that a malicious player can choose to increase the load of as many edges as possible.
\end{enumerate}
